# Credit Risk Modeling with German Credit Data

This project implements an end-to-end **credit risk modeling pipeline** using the classic German Credit dataset.
It follows the **IFRS 9 / Basel framework**, covering:

- **PD (Probability of Default)** modeling with logistic regression + calibration
- **LGD (Loss Given Default)** simulation and modeling with Random Forests
- **EAD (Exposure at Default)** simulation based on credit utilization assumptions
- **ECL (Expected Credit Loss)** calculation with portfolio summaries and segment analysis
- **Stress testing** under adverse economic scenarios

The workflow includes **EDA, model training, visualization, and portfolio risk analysis**.
